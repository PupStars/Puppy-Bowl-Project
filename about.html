    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="about-text">We are working with the Humane Society to add a mini-game to their website. The game allows visitors to create teams of puppies to compete in a "Puppy Bowl". The objective is to create the cutest and most skilled team of puppies to win the championship.</p>
    <p class="about-text">The API and some of the front-end have already been built to provide the necessary functionality for the game. Visitors can select puppies from a list of available breeds, customize their team's name and jersey, and compete against other teams in exciting matches.</p>
    <p class="about-text">Our goal is to create an engaging and entertaining experience for visitors while promoting the adoption of puppies from the Humane Society. By participating in the game, visitors can learn about different breeds, their characteristics, and the importance of responsible pet ownership.</p>
    <p class="about-text">Join us in the Puppy Bowl adventure and let's have fun while supporting a great cause!</p>
